            Had an Amazing time here! Although it is a young company but I'm
            sure they will go a long way. My job here is pretty much everything,
            from making the website (which I did do a pretty good job of it,
            better than the last one) to sell server maintenance license, server
            hardware, financial work like open up Purchase Order, Invoice, Etc.
            Even deliver the goods !! Basically I am the Sales Manager /
            Assistant Director / Tech guy And I enjoy it a lot!

          <p>
            Next is PT. Asaba Computer Centre, quite a well known IT company in
            Indonesia. After I learned my sales skills at two of my previous
            companies I decided to try and learn a thing or two about selling at
            an Enterprise level. Here, I pretty much sell at about everything
            related to Computers, from hardware to software. Can't say I had a
            good time here, the office environment is okay but not to my liking.
            Overall, Learned a lot on a corporate level.

          <h6>PT. Multisukses Wahana Karya</h6>
          <p>
            I remember I had a very good time in this company. Awesome
            colleagues, lots of experience learned, made lots of new friends. It
            was a really wonderful sales learning experience, I went to many
            different places pitching other companies to buy our products (Heavy
            Machinery). The owner of this company really taught me many things,
            he even asked me to come to his house for a lesson. That shows
            passion right there, I am lucky to become a part of the team. So
            Thank you Sir! I wish you all the best!
